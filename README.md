# concept_maps
**Description:** Approaches and tinkering with ideas for making concept maps.  Concept maps are useful for visualizing information, communicating ideas, learning, reinforcing concepts, brainstorming ideas, and planning.  

## One Manaul Approach with Some Automation

## Example Result
Here I use concept maps for active learning: to digest, better remember, and reinforce the ideas presented from Thomas Kuhn's [_The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_][kuhn].  This example concept map was formed after spending ~2 days reading Kuhn's seminal work for the first time.  2 days is not enough time to read and ponder it in the depth it deserves.  One of the reasons I found a concept map useful here was that helped focus me to identify his key points, terms, and ideas and understand how they relate and affect each other.

## Status & Possible Future To-dos
- [x] develop manual process
- [x] automate ingestion of pdf text
- [x] automate word cloud generation
- [ ] improve ideas for overall process 
- [ ] improve automation (less common key terms, grouping, categorizing, concept map generation)
- [ ] consider tying to other methods e.g., LLMs
